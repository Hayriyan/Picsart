Sure, here's a basic README file for your code:

---

# Description
This program demonstrates how to dynamically load and execute a function from a shared object file (a.o) using mmap. It also shows how to pass a structure to the function and access its members.

# Files
- `main.c`: Contains the main program logic to load and execute the function from `a.o`.
- `a.c`: Contains the function `mod` that calculates the sum of `x` and `y` from a `Vector` structure.
- `vector.h`: Header file defining the `Vector` structure.

# Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command:
```
gcc main.c -o main
```

# Execution
To execute the program, run the following command:
```
./main
```

You may want to add more details about the purpose of the code, how to use it, and any special considerations or dependencies required.
